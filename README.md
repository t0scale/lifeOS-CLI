# lifeOS CLI

## Purpose
The lifeOS CLI is designed to help automate various aspects of the the life operating system within notion while also integrating and automating popular third party applications.

## History & Status
This CLI initially began as a personal project to help automate repetitive tasks I found myself engaging in. The initial features were to automatically generate a new entry (ie. page) within my Daily Tracking database while inputting:
- Current date
- Time I went to bed
- Time I awoke
- Duration in bed
- Duration asleep

The application is currently being built for wider general use and currently won't work unless you make some extensive changes to the base code. 

I will soon expand on what the necessary changes are in a short while so that those with light coding experience can work through a manual setup.
